These ldif files are a work in progess.


The intent is to replace hard coded values in config.ldif with templated values that are passed in at runtime. 

This should only be applied when you are ready to "Freeze dry" the configuration after all setup is finished.

The resulting configuration can be packed up and used to reinitialize another environment.
